        <p>The largely hairless Sphynx is very people-oriented and affectionate. They are highly intelligent,
            playful, cuddly, often described as being "part dog, part child, part monkey,
            and part cat". They display a high level of energy, intelligence, curiosity, and
            affection for their owners.</p>
